# Overview

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, have seen a growth in popularity as more of the general population has come to realize the importance of maintaining data privacy and security while browsing the Internet. VPNs route their usersâ€™ network traffic data through their own private servers, allowing them to provide these users with extra anonymity and protection by disguising the details of their network activity. However, even with the loss of detail such as packet destination, user activity in a VPN tunnel is still identifiable.

Over the last ten weeks, we have built a classifier that is able to identify the resolution/quality of video while in a VPN tunnel. Our model is an extension of a previous binary classifer that was able to determine if a user was streaming video or not while in a VPN tunnel.

# The Data

Network traffic data was collected via the Viasat provided script, [network-stats](https://github.com/viasat/network-stats). The script collects details such as bytes being sent to the server/to the local machine on a second and millisecond level of detail.

Our dataset is comprised of over 25 hours of network traffic of video playback from YouTube. YouTube was our primary source of video data as it allows full autonomy over video quality. The data collection process was also automated via a Selenium script developed by a group member.

A key feature of our data is the increasing byte amount required to support increasing resolution. As you will see below, many of our features attempt to capture the

### Here is an unordered list:

- Item foo
- Item bar
- Item baz
- Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
